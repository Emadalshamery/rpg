## Details

You're a kid who lives in some town. You just moved there a few weeks ago (so you don't really know anyone at school or in the town yet). When you start the game, everything is peaceful. You wake up and start walking to school. On the way, you overhear a couple of people talking in the streets; one tells the other how they were haunted by ghosts in the middle of the night. Another conversation is similar. You keep walking. You overhear some other people talking about how Mr. So-and-So suddenly went missing last night. "Yeah," says the other person, "there were similar reports all over town... I read it in the newspaper." Clearly, something is going on. You get to school. Lots of your peers' parents have gone missing. Then you get the call too. You run outside and suddenly you watch one by one as everyone in the town turns invisible!

So, apparently, some evil force has decided to take over the town. Thing is, they're in another dimension -- something you find out when you suddenly find yourself in another world. (This would explain why the townspeople kept seeing ghosts... actually the monsters were going in and out of phase.) For some reason, though, this evil force has decided not to take you -- either you are insignificant, or you are special in some way and they are luring you to their base or something.

Of course you have NO IDEA what's going on. All you know is, you're in this strange other world, and it's up to you to stop this evil. The rest of the game is basically you trying to make your way to the evil HQ. There are various places you have to pass through -- most of them are bad, filled with monsters. The least powerful of them you are able to kill with your trusty slingshot. You'll collect more powerful weapons, though.

Along the way you encounter friendly monsters who are secretly trying to put a stop to this evil too, and as you talk to some of them you start to figure out what you need to do. One of these friendlies works in the HQ, and while you're trying to get there, she's trying to make it to you. She isn't much older than you are, but she knows a lot more about you than you do. There will be cutscenes at various points in the game that reveal this backstory (which at first seems disconnected but starts to make more sense), but in the end, she finds you. "There isn't much time!" she says. "We have to hurry!"

Just then, she flashes out of view. You think you've lost her, but you hear her voice. Turns out they've found out about her, and she's been whisked away to yet another dimension. "But never mind that now," she says. "We have to hurry!" You sneak into the castle and with her help, you start to take down the evil force from the inside. Finally you come to the final boss (who, naturally, knows your true nature and has been waiting for you the whole time), and somehow you take him down in Street Fighter style [no, I'm just kidding, I'm not sure].

After you make the final blow to kill the boss, there's a flash of white light and when you come to, you're suddenly right back in the town, and everyone is going about their business like nothing happened. Maybe nothing did happen? But then this girl that you met in the other dimension runs over (yeah, you get to see her in person for only the second time) and thanks you. And here's where she tells her side of the story and you find out what was really going on. She also tells you who you really are and where you came from (or at least the rest of the little she told you earlier).
